Delete a Version from a Software Title
======================================

DELETE /api/v1/titles/{ID}/version/{VERSION}
---------------------------------------------

Delete a version from a software title's definition. The advertised
``currentVersion`` will be updated to reflect whatever the most 'recent" version
is after the operation.

.. note::

    You must have at least one (1) version defined for a software title. The
    API will respond with a 400 error if you attempt to delete the last
    remaining version.

.. warning::

    Use caution and judgement when deleting a version from a software title.
    You may negatively impact other admins using the definition for their own
    patch reports and policies!
